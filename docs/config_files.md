# Config files
Environment configuration lives in `config.yml` and `environment`.

`config.yml` can be found under:

`/etc/.stylist/` merged and overriden by:
 
`~/.stylist/` merged and overriden by:

`$PROJ_ROOT/.stylist/`
 

A config file that does not exist in a location is just ignored.  

The keys which can be set in the configuration files are explained in the **Commands**
section wherever they are required.
